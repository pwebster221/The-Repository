# AstroAPI Readme

Refocus from API calls to queries of the Swiss ephemeris. 

## Planned
### Natal Chart Info
Will query the Swiss ephemeris for astrological positions at time of birth.
Will run returned positions through function to define natal aspects
once defined, will send natal cart information to Neo4j
### Transit Chart Info
Will query the Swiss ephemeris for astrological positions currently.
Will set returned current positions with submitters natal positions and use similar, if not the same aspect defining function
Once Aspects are defined, needs to be sent to Neo4j
